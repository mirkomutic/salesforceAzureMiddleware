# salesforceAzureMiddleware
This repository contains a sample implementation of serverless azure functions that can be used as a middleware in your system landscape. I provide the neccessary utilities to connect to salesforce rest api and forward any records to it. The framework should allow you to include different systems and scale as you go.
